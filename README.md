# COVID-19 VACCINE ANALYSIS

            Analyzing COVID-19 vaccines is a critical component of the global response to the ongoing pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. These vaccines have been developed at an unprecedented pace and are essential tools in controlling the spread of the virus and reducing the severity of the disease.
            Vaccine analysis involves a multifaceted approach that encompasses various aspects, including efficacy, safety, distribution, public acceptance, and their impact on the pandemic One of the primary aspects of analyzing COVID-19 vaccines is assessing their efficacy and effectiveness. This involves conducting clinical trials to determine how well the vaccines prevent infection, reduce the severity of illness, and curb the transmission of the virus. Vaccine trials typically involve large-scale, double-blind studies with diverse populations.  

         
# Dataset Information

Dataset link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress 
 


# Attribute Information:

<li> Country- this is the country for which the vaccination information is provided;
 <li>Country ISO Code - ISO code for the country; 
<li>Date - date for the data entry; for some of the dates we have only the daily vaccinations, for others, only the (cumulative) total;
<li> Total number of vaccinations - this is the absolute number of total immunizations in the country; 
<li>Total number of people vaccinated - a person, depending on the immunization scheme, will receive one or more (typically 2) vaccines; at a certain moment, the number of vaccination might be larger than the number of people; 
<li>Total number of people fully vaccinated - this is the number of people that received the entire set of immunization according to the immunization scheme.

# Conclusion:
           
              In conclusion, the analysis of COVID-19 vaccines has been an instrumental component of our global response to the pandemic. Through a multifaceted approach, researchers, public health officials, and healthcare professionals have evaluated various aspects of these vaccines to ensure their efficacy, safety, and impact. 
              COVID-19 vaccines have proven to be highly effective in preventing infection, reducing the severity of illness, and curbing the spread of the virus, both in controlled clinical trials and real-worldÂ settings.
